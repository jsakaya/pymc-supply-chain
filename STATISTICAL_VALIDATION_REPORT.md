# Statistical Validation Report for PyMC-Supply-Chain Demand Models

## Executive Summary

We have implemented a comprehensive statistical validation framework to test the correctness and reliability of the PyMC-Supply-Chain demand forecasting models. This validation suite goes beyond simple "does it run" tests to ensure the models produce **statistically valid, economically meaningful results**.

## Current Status: CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**⚠️ All models currently FAIL statistical validation due to fundamental architectural issues.**

### Key Findings:

1. **Models fit successfully** ✅ - The PyMC model building and MCMC sampling works
2. **Forecasting completely broken** ❌ - All models fail during forecast generation due to broadcast shape mismatches
3. **Core architectural flaw**: The forecast methodology has tensor shape incompatibilities that prevent proper posterior predictive sampling

## Statistical Validation Framework

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite (`test_statistical_validation.py`)

This is the complete validation framework that tests:

- **Forecast Correctness**:
  - Non-negative forecasts for count distributions
  - Proper uncertainty quantification (95% intervals)
  - No NaN/Inf values
  - Forecasts in reasonable economic range

- **Posterior Predictive Checks**:
  - Mean and variance consistency with observed data
  - Distribution shape validation using quantiles
  - Zero-inflation testing for intermittent models

- **Model-Specific Validations**:
  - **Hierarchical**: Tests that pooling actually works (different forecasts for different hierarchy levels)
  - **Intermittent**: Verifies sporadic patterns, not flat lines
  - **Seasonal**: Checks that seasonal patterns are captured correctly

- **Distribution Compliance**:
  - Negative binomial produces non-negative integers
  - Poisson produces count data
  - Gamma produces positive continuous values

### 2. Simplified Validation Suite (`test_statistical_validation_simple.py`)

This focused test identifies core functionality issues:

- Basic model fitting and forecasting capability
- Forecast format validation
- Statistical consistency checks
- Distribution property verification

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Broadcast Shape Mismatches (All Models)

**Error Pattern**: `shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape. Mismatch is between arg 0 with shape (N,) and arg 1 with shape (M,)`

**Root Cause**: The forecasting implementation in `base.py` and related models has fundamental tensor shape incompatibilities when using `pm.set_data()` and `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()`.

**Impact**: **Complete forecasting failure** - models cannot generate any forecasts.

### 2. ArviZ API Compatibility Issues

**Issue**: The test suite uses outdated ArviZ API calls (`az.sample_posterior_predictive` should be `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`).

**Status**: Fixed in validation code, but indicates potential API version mismatches.

### 3. Model Specification Problems

**Hierarchical Models**: Show initialization failures with infinite likelihood values, indicating fundamental specification errors in the hierarchical structure.

## Validation Results by Model

| Model | Fitting | Forecasting | Overall Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Base Normal | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Base Negative Binomial | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Base Poisson | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Base Gamma | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Hierarchical | ❌ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Intermittent ZINB | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Intermittent ZIP | ✅ | ❌ | **FAIL** |
| Seasonal | ❌ | ❌ | **FAIL** |

**Success Rate: 0/8 models (0%)**

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Forecasting Architecture

1. **Reshape tensor operations** in the `forecast()` methods to ensure compatible broadcasting
2. **Review data container updates** in `pm.set_data()` calls
3. **Validate posterior predictive sampling** implementation

### Priority 2: Fix Hierarchical Model Specification

1. **Debug infinite likelihood** issues in hierarchical models
2. **Validate coordinate systems** for hierarchical dimensions
3. **Test parameter initialization** strategies

### Priority 3: Enhanced Validation

1. **Complete posterior predictive checks** once forecasting works
2. **Add coverage probability tests** for uncertainty intervals
3. **Implement model comparison metrics**

## Statistical Validation Benefits

### What This Framework Provides:

1. **Rigorous Quality Assurance**: Goes far beyond unit tests to validate statistical correctness
2. **Economic Validity**: Ensures forecasts make business sense (non-negative, reasonable ranges)
3. **Model Comparison**: Systematic framework for evaluating model performance
4. **Production Readiness**: Validates models are suitable for real-world deployment

### Tests We Can Run Once Issues Are Fixed:

- **Coverage Tests**: Do 95% intervals actually contain 95% of observations?
- **Hierarchical Pooling**: Do hierarchical models properly shrink estimates toward group means?
- **Intermittent Detection**: Do sporadic demand models correctly identify and forecast irregular patterns?
- **Seasonal Accuracy**: Do seasonal models capture and project seasonal patterns?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix broadcast shape issues** in all `forecast()` methods
2. **Debug hierarchical model initialization** problems
3. **Run full statistical validation suite** once fixes are implemented
4. **Document model limitations** and appropriate use cases

### Long-term Improvements:

1. **Add cross-validation tests** for out-of-sample performance
2. **Implement model selection criteria** (WAIC, LOO-CV)
3. **Add economic validation** (forecast accuracy, inventory optimization performance)
4. **Create automated testing pipeline** for continuous validation

## Conclusion

The statistical validation framework reveals that while the PyMC-Supply-Chain models have sound theoretical foundations and can fit data successfully, **critical implementation bugs prevent them from generating forecasts**. This is a blocking issue that must be resolved before the models can be used in any production capacity.

The validation framework itself is comprehensive and ready to thoroughly test the models once the architectural issues are fixed. This will ensure that the final implementation produces statistically valid, economically meaningful demand forecasts suitable for supply chain optimization.
